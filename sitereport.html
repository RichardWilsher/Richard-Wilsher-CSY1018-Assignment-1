            <h2>
                Introduction
            </h2>
            <p>
                Design and implement a website to showcase our HTML and CSS learning from term 1 of CSY1018 Web Development, utilising GitHub to employ version control techniques.
            </p>
            <h2>
                Design
            </h2>
            <p>
                I initially decided on a clean and simple user interface, primarily a white background with grey accents, for the layout, as shown in figure 1.  The Header section 
                is taking up the whole of the top part of the page, with the Nav section directly below it and the Footer taking up the bottom of the page.  My design then split 
                the rest of the page into 3 sections, the Aside taking up the left, Main in the middle and a section called Side on the right. I decdied to use font's from 
                <a href="https://fonts.google.com/">google fonts</a> as it ensures, whilst the fonts are located on google font's the fonts I intended will be displayed, regardless of
                platform or browser it is viewed in.
            </p>
            <p>
                The content to be included for the Aside, Main and Side sections was: the Aside is to have a brief summary of the content of the Main section of the page, the Side 
                section was to be blank on each page, other than the portfolio.html page where it is to display more information when a portfolio element is selected. 
            </p>
            <p>
                For the mobile site, shown in figure 2, I rearranged the sections to fit onto a smaller screen, losing the side section, and having the nav section appear when the 
                hamburger menu icon is clicked and disappear when clicked again. The aside was positioned above the main section, so the summary of the page would be before main 
                part of the page and the footer would remain at the bottom of the page.
            </p>

            </div>
            <h2>
                The Journey
            </h2>
            <div>
            <p>
                I started by creating 5 blank HTML and 3 blank CSS files for the site, I decided to use 3 CSS files, one for most of the CSS which is shared between both 
                the mobile and desktop sites and then a CSS file for the 2 viewing variants.  My reasons for this are to keep the formatting consistent across the desktop 
                and mobile CSS files, as well as making it easier to maintain the CSS code, rather than having the same code on both mobile and desktop CSS files.
            </p>
            <p>
                Next step was to start adding content to the HTML pages, I added the links to the Nav section on all the pages as well as adding basic text to both Aside 
                and Footer sections. Most of the work was adding content to the index, CV as shown in figure 3, portfolio and contact pages, for the portfolio page, I started 
                adding more information as I had planned to do in my design.  At this point it became clear, as shown in figure 4, my plan for the Side section on the portfolio 
                page would not work, due to not being responsive and the consistent look across the whole site would have had to have been sacrificed.
            </p>
            <div>
                <a href="figure3.png"><img src="figure3.png" alt="Figure 3"></a> 
                <p class="nopaddedline"> 
                    Figure 3
                    </p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <a href="figure4.png"><img src="figure4.png" alt="Figure 4"></a> <p class="nopaddedline"> 
                    Figure 4
                </p>
            </div>
            <p>
                I removed the Side section entirely as without the additional portfolio information, it had become irrelevant, I also removed the page summary on the Aside 
                section mainly due to consistency across the mobile and desktop versions.  The Header section was added, including my profile picture and the hamburger menu 
                was added to the mobile sites’ CSS.
            </p>
            <p>
                Due to an issue with the hamburger menu, where it would be open when you loaded the page and the hamburger icon would show whilst the menu is open and the 
                cross would show when the menu was closed, I decided to branch the project to work on the issue, without the risk of completely breaking the hamburger menu.  
                After fixing the issue, I merged the branch back into the main.
            </p>
            <p>
                I created another branch to work on animation for the Nav menu, starting with the desktop version of the site, having a couple of links coming down when you 
                hovered the mouse over the work Links in the Nav section. After adding that I decided to create another branch to work on adding animation to the mobile version, 
                whilst I managed to get the additional links to appear on screen when you pressed on the Links text, it wasn’t animated and I realised at this point, being mobile, 
                there was not a mouse over hover function, due to this, and the unintuitive feeling to that additional menu on mobile, I abandoned the branch and I decided to 
                instead have the mobile Nav menu as a staggered menu on the animated menu branch, which I merged into main.
            </p>
            <p>
                With most of the functionality of the site in place and enough content in place, my next step was to start formatting the elements of the site, so that it would 
                start to take shape.  Starting with the CV page, then working on the portfolio page and finally the contact page.
            </p>
            <p>
                I decided to take what I had learnt with drawing the Hamburger menu and changing it to a cross shape and instead of using a placeholder image to the portfolio page, 
                I would instead use CSS to draw a box with a cross through it.
            </p>
            <p>
                With the rest of the site in close to its final form, I started work on this the sitereport page as I felt I had enough of the site completed to start writing my 
                journey.
            </p>
            <p>
                With only the very last part of my journey to document and conclusion to write, I went back to the other pages and started tidying up my code, I added a keyframe 
                animation to the portfolio page to show I was able to do that and I felt the portfolio was the best place for it to be, I added CSS code to change the basic look 
                of the site depending on whether the user had dark mode activated or not, as dark mode is a feature gaining more and more traction recently, especially on mobile.
            </p>
            <p>
                I changed the colour scheme from greys to warmer blues and added an image to the background of the Header section, a picture I took of the scenery of Exmoor close 
                to where I grew up, to make the site look less sterile.  I also added a single set of columns to my CV page as the brief asked for columns, however the technical 
                CV style I was using did not entirely fit with a column style.
            </p>
            <p>
                I decided at this point to validate both my HTML and CSS with the online validators.  There were no issues with the HTML and a small number of issues with the CSS, 
                the main issue with the CSS was the dark mode detection I employed as it is not supported on all web browser platforms, due to this and when viewed in dark mode, 
                the site would look different to what I had originally intended, I removed it from my final CSS.
            </p>
            <p>
                Finally, I had this page to finish, validation to check and add and a clean-up of the CSS code and content of the pages before it is completed.   
            </p>
            </div>
            <h2>
                Conclusion
            </h2>
            <p>
                Overall, the journey has been an interesting one, firstly as I initially learnt HTML back when HTML 2.0 was still considered new and CSS was not widespread, 
                learning the modern method of website design where most of the HTML formatting tags are no longer used, instead the formatting is done within CSS, was initially 
                a surprise, but as it makes sites more consistent and much easier to maintain, it makes sense.  I feel I have learnt a lot, but I have also only scratched the 
                surface of what is available with CSS. 
            </p>
            <p>
                The use of version control via the GitHub service is also an incredibly useful service, I can see that as I progress through the course, it will become more and 
                more useful, especially with the group project, where multiple people can push and pull code to and from the project. Whilst I chose to work on only one branch 
                at a time to avoid merge conflicts for this project, that is something I will investigate how to deal with on my own personal projects where accidentally merging 
                the wrong data would not be an issue. 
            </p>
            <p>
                My initial design I stuck to as closely as possibly, but from early on it was clear some of my design choices were, better as a concept than a practical aspect of 
                the site, which is something I learnt incredibly early in the site’s development, however GitHub allowed me to make changes to the site without risking breaking 
                other parts of the site, especially when fixing the Hamburger menu and looking at animating the menus.
