            <h2>
                Introduction
            </h2>
            <p>
                Design and implement a website to showcase our HTML and CSS learning from term 1 of CSY1018 Web Development, utilising GitHub to employ version control techniques.
            </p>
            <h2>
                Design
            </h2>
            <p>
                I initially decided on a clean and simple user interface, primarily a white background with grey accents, for the layout, as shown in figure 1. I initially decided to 
                go for the header at the top of the screen with my profile picture and name, below, running left to right, the nav links. On the left of the screen, the aside section 
                was on the right with a brief summery of the contents of the page and another side section on the right.  The footer was positioned along the bottom of the page in its 
                standard position.  The side to the right was initially going to have more information on the items in my portfolio when the user clicks on the more info link.  However, 
                this idea would require both the portfolio page to be displayed differently to the rest of the website and not responsive. 
            </p>
            <p>
                For the mobile site, shown in figure 2, I rearranged the sections to fit onto a smaller screen, losing the side section, and having the nav section appear when the 
                hamburger menu icon is clicked and disappear when clicked again. The aside was positioned above the main section, so the summary of the page would be before main 
                part of the page and the footer would remain at the bottom of the page.
            </p>
            <h2>
                The Journey
            </h2>
            <p>
                Design in hand I began the journey to create the HTML and CSS files that would form the site.  I decided to use 3 CSS files, mobile.css for the mobile site, 
                desktop.css for the desktop site and main.css which contains most of the formatting and ensures both mobile and desktop sites remain consistent and easier to 
                maintain.  With that decision made, I started by creating barebones CSS and HTML files, where I started adding the basic content and simple formatting.  This 
                allowed me to see how the site would start to look, so I can make changes if needed as I go along.  I added the hamburger menu to the mobile CSS, added the 
                information for the aside on the portfolio page, then removed it due to inconsistent look of the page and issues making it responsive.  Created my first branch 
                to work on the hamburger menu, which whilst it was working, it was working in reverse, it started open with the hamburger icon and when closed, showed the cross 
                icon. I branched here, so that I could work on the code safely, in case I broke it beyond my capacity to fix or return to its original state. Having successfully 
                corrected the code and figuring out the missing HTML code on all pages other than index.html I merged the branch back into the master branch.
            </p>
            <p>
                I then made my second branch to work on adding animation to the NAV menu, again this was to keep the working code safe whilst I added and played around with different 
                types of animation effects, trying to figure out which I liked most and fitted with the style of the site.  I created my third branch off of the second whilst I tried 
                to get animation effects working off of the hamburger menu menu.  After getting a hover effect to bring up the additional menu, although they were in reverse order, 
                I realised that a hover menu effect wouldn’t be in the best interest of the mobile site, as mobiles don’t have mice, and it is not intuitive that additional menu items 
                could be there, on realising this, I re-evaluated my expectations and decided to add them to the mobile menu in a more standard tiered fashion for the mobile version 
                of the site, because of this change, I abandoned that branch.
            </p>
            <p>
                With the NAV working on both the desktop and mobile site, I continued adding the formatting to both the HTML and the CSS for the contact, CV and then the portfolio 
                pages, including drawing a box with a cross through it in CSS for the placeholder images.
            </p>
            <p>
                With the majority of the content and formatting complete for the other pages, I started on this sitereport page.
